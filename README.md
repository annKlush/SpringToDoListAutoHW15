Task #1 - Add Spring Security module:
Add the Spring Security module to the project by including the spring-boot-starter-security dependency.

Run the project and verify that the module is successfully integrated by checking the generated password in the console logs. 
Ensure that upon accessing the web interface, you are redirected to the authentication page where you need to enter the login and password displayed in the console.

Task #2 - Set your own login and password:
Using an autogenerated password each time can be inconvenient.

Set the password to "default" by configuring it in the application.properties file, for example.

As a result, you should be able to access your own application using the login "user" and the password "default".
